Utah is a prime example of a gerrymanderable state. Its population map is especially vulnerable to "packing" and "cracking".

Utah is, on average, sparsely populated. Its capital, Salt Lake City, and surrounding counties, a dense area. It hosts the plurality of the state's Democrats. On the other hand, the other areas are low-density areas, and they host the majority of the state's Republicans.

Utah's current voting district set up involves "cracking" Salt Lake's population into four districts, each of which have broad areas that use the spread out Republicans to overcome the liberal, Salt Lake City portion they have been allotted.
