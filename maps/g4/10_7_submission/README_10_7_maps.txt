10_7_submission consists of two maps, roughly based off of districts that break up Salt Lake City, Utah. 

Simplified* set-up, for easier analysis:

map_utah_2_rightish_test25:
- 1/2 of population (a normal distribution whose mean is at the centroid of the triangle) favors one party; meant to represent Salt Lake City
- other 1/2, favoring other party, is situated more along the border of the triangle; meant to represent surrounding conservative population

map_utah_3_rightish_test25:
- 1/3 of pop represents liberal, centrally-located Salt Lake City population
- 1/3 represents conservative populations in surrounding area
- 1/3 represents independent populations in surrounding area
