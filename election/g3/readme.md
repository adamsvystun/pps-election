#Group 3

##About our implementation
The class `election.g3.DistrictGenerator` on line 36 defines the index (0-based) of the party to favor
in the gerrymandering process.
After the run the generator will print the expected number of seats that each party
would get based only on the proportions of the voter preference in the population. This is
useful as a baseline.

The generator also prints the total of wasted votes for each party based on the
generated districts.
